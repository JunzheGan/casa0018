# Human Facial emotion detection model

Junzhe Gan

## Introduction
The inspiration of this project is from PwC Game-based Assessment. One of their tasks is asking candidates to match human face showing leftwards with correct emotion showing on the right.

This has motivated me to use deep learning techniques building a model which can swiftly detect human facial emotions.  

## Research Question
What is the problem you are trying to solve

*probably 1 or 2 sentences*

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
The data is derived from Kaggle Emotion Detection dataset. The dataset originally have images categorised into seven feelings group, for simplicity, only data showing happy and sad emotions are used. Moreover, 189 pictures containing people with different race, age and gender are carefully selected from thousands of happy images to use as training data for "happy" category and 24 pictures are used as testing data. The same happened for choosing training and test data for "sad". The dataset used is showing below:

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?


*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
